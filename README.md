<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The Time Management App is a multiplatform mobile application developed as a personal project to learn and practice React Native programming and gain hands-on experience with Firebase and Firestore database services. This app serves as a practical exercise in building a real-world application, and it focuses on helping users manage their time effectively.

The time management app was primarily developed using the iOS simulator to ensure a seamless and visually appealing experience for iOS users. However, I understand the importance of inclusivity, so the app has also been extensively tested on Android devices to ensure cross-platform compatibility. 

In this personal project of mine, it's important to acknowledge that there may be bugs and areas where improvements are needed. _In the world of programming, as in any creative endeavour, the pursuit of flawless perfection can be a highly demanding endeavour._
